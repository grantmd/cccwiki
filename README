What?
==========
A wiki that runs on Google App Engine. Based on the original code from Google, which has not been maintained.

Why?
==========
I had a need for a lightweight wiki I could run on Google App Engine. Running it on App Engine meant I didn't have to worry about hosting it myself, and with the traffic I was expecting, it would be free. All the Python wiki software I could find was either flat out incompatible with App Engine or Django-based. I've been down the road of trying to get Django apps running on App Engine, and I never want to go back there.

Google had provided cccwiki as one of their App Engine examples, but it lacked basic wiki features like tracking history, feeds, and search. So I decided to take the code, put it on github, and hack at it until it did what I wanted. Hopefully it ends up being useful for someone else too.
